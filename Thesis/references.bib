  abstract = {Nonlinearities in rotating systems have been seen to cause a wide variety of rich phenomena; however, the understanding of these phenomena has been limited because numerical approaches typically rely on ``brute force'' time simulation, which is slow due to issues of step size and settling time, cannot locate unstable solution families, and may miss key responses if the correct initial conditions are not used. This work uses numerical continuation to explore the responses of such systems in a more systematic way. A simple isotropic rotor system with a smooth nonlinearity is studied, and the rotating frame is used to obtain periodic solutions. Asynchronous responses with oscillating amplitude are seen to initiate at certain drive speeds due to internal resonance, in a manner similar to that observed for nonsmooth rotor--stator contact systems in the previous literature. These responses are isolated, in the sense that they will only meet the more trivial synchronous responses in the limit of zero damping and out of balance forcing. In addition to increasing our understanding of the responses of these systems, the work establishes the potential of numerical continuation as a tool to systematically explore the responses of nonlinear rotor systems.},

  abstract = {In this study a mechanical model of an overhung rotor is explored to determine the effect of gravity on the nonlinear dynamics of an aero-engine. The model is an overhung disc with rotor-stator contact. The model has two degrees of freedom with lumped parameters; friction is neglected in the contact and the equations of motion are non-dimensionalised. A parametric study of the non-dimensional gravity parameter is conducted. The bifurcation plots show that gravity plays a crucial role in the nonlinear dynamics of such systems. With zero gravity, as explored in earlier studies, the model has synchronous whirling solutions, and asynchronous partially contacting solutions that are periodic only when viewed in a rotating coordinate system. If the gravity parameter is non-zero, then the dynamics observed are much richer and show additional multi-periodic and chaotic solutions in the stationary frame and continuous contact (full annular rub).},

  abstract = {The efficiency of rotating machines can be improved via precisely manufactured bearings with reduced clearances; consequently, the proclivity for rotor--stator contact is increased. A common model used to investigate rotor--stator contact in previous studies is the two degree-of-freedom (DOF) rotor with symmetric support stiffness, where the contact assumes a linear elastic normal restoring force proportional to the rotor--stator interference and a tangential dry Coulomb friction force. Switching between the contacting and non-contacting states creates strong nonlinearity in the equations of motion, and the dynamic response displays a rich profile of behaviors including periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic responses via period-doubling, sudden transitions, quasiperiodicity, and intermittency. For the first time, this work emphasizes an asymmetric support stiffness matrix with cross-coupling between the x and y direction stiffnesses. The influence of support asymmetry on the nonlinear rotor response is shown using rotor orbits, frequency spectra, Poincar{\'e} sections, and bifurcation diagrams. It is found that the cross-coupling stiffness coefficient kxy has negligible effect on the dynamic response until its magnitude is on the same order as the direct stiffness coefficients. Direct stiffness coefficient asymmetry is shown to affect the rotor×³s response, where even small asymmetries can qualitatively change the response. Additionally, the importance of including gravity is investigated, and a method is provided for determining the threshold shaft speed above which gravity can be ignored. The dominant route to chaos is period-doubling for the parameters considered here, though other routes to chaos are seen such as a direct transition from periodic to chaotic motion. Finally, observations pertaining to rotor modeling, design, and fault diagnostics are discussed.},
