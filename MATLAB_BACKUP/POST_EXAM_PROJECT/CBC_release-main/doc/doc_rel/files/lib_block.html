    <h1>Library Blocks</h1>
    <p>
        The software is distributed as a library, ensuring seamless integration and ease of use within Simulink. Upon
        executing <code>setup_cbc.m</code>, all necessary protected blocks are extracted, and the contents of the
        <code>src</code> folder are automatically added to the MATLAB path. This process includes both protected and
        unprotected blocks provided with the software. Additionally, the <code>library</code> folder, containing the
        core library, is also added to the MATLAB path.
    </p>

    <h2>Accessing the Library</h2>
    <p>
        Once the setup process is complete, users can create a new Simulink model and access the library through the
        Simulink Library Browser. The library is listed under <strong>CBC Library</strong>. If the library does not
        appear immediately, try refreshing the Library Browser by right-clicking on the library list and selecting
        <strong>Refresh Library Browser</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        After opening the library, users can drag and drop the required blocks into their Simulink model to construct
        their system.
    </p>

    <h2>Protected Blocks and Associated Data</h2>
    <p>
        The protected blocks included in the software are distributed as MATLAB project files (<code>.mlproj</code>).
        When <code>setup_cbc.m</code> is run, these files are extracted into designated folders.
        Certain blocks also require additional data stored in <code>.mat</code> files, which will be located in their
        respective extracted folders.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users must manually load the corresponding <code>.mat</code> file when using these blocks, as there is currently
        no automated mechanism for this. If an error occurs during simulation regarding missing variables, it is likely
        due to an unloaded <code>.mat</code> file. Ensure that the required file is manually loaded before using the
        block.
    </p>

    <h2>Alternative Method: Manual Block Access</h2>
    <p>
        While using the library is the recommended approach, users also have the option to manually locate and copy
        blocks from the <code>src</code> folder. Protected blocks can be accessed from their harness files, which are
        stored in their respective extracted folders and follow the naming convention:
    </p>
    <pre><code>*_harness.slx</code></pre>
    <p>
        Unprotected blocks can be accessed directly from the <code>src</code> folder and copied into the model without
        additional steps.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although this manual method is available, the library is designed to streamline workflow and simplify block
        integration, making it the preferred method for using the software.
